 Short Report (Comparison and Use Case Analysis)
Compare and contrast the technical capabilities of each
The three platforms demonstrate distinct technical capabilities tailored for different use cases. Ethereum, as a public blockchain, offers maximum decentralization and smart contract flexibility but suffers from lower throughput (15-30 TPS). Hyperledger Fabric provides enterprise-grade performance (1000+ TPS) with strict privacy controls through its channel system, ideal for confidential business processes. R3 Corda's consortium model balances these approaches with 170+ TPS and unique "state" objects that only share data with involved parties.


Which platform would you choose for:

For a decentralized app, I would choose Ethereum due to its robust smart contract ecosystem, EVM compatibility, and native token support - crucial for Web3 applications. 
A supply chain network among known partners?

For a supply chain network among known partners, Hyperledger Fabric is optimal. Its permissioned model ensures privacy between participants, while pluggable consensus allows customization for specific supply chain requirements.
An inter-bank financial application? And Justify your choice based on technical points.

For inter-bank financial applications, R3 Corda stands out. Its notary-based consensus provides the auditability banks require, while the consortium model maintains control among trusted institutions. The platform's design for financial workflows (like its "states" model) makes it particularly suited for this use case.
