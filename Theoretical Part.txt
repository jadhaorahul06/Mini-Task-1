Theoretical Part 
1. Blockchain Basics 
Definition: 
A blockchain is a distributed, immutable digital ledger that records transactions across a 
network of computers. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, 
creating a secure chain. This decentralized structure eliminates single points of failure 
and enables trustless transactions. 
Real-Life Use Cases: 
1. Supply Chain Tracking: Companies like Walmart use blockchain to trace food products 
from farm to store, improving transparency and safety. 
2. Digital Voting: Blockchain can create tamper-proof voting systems where each vote is 
verifiable but anonymous. 
2. Block Anatomy 
Block Structure: 
Block          
Data: Transactions   Previous Hash: abc1Timestamp: 1234567   Nonce: 42            Merkle Root: xyz9     
Merkle Root Example: 
Imagine a block with 4 transactions. The Merkle root is a single hash representing all 
transactions. If even one transaction changes, the Merkle root changes completely, 
making tampering evident. 
3. Consensus Mechanisms 
Proof of Work (PoW): 
Miners compete to solve complex math problems to validate blocks. This requires 
massive energy because miners must make millions of guesses per second (e.g., Bitcoin). 
Proof of Stake (PoS): 
Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they "stake" as collateral. 
More energy-efficient than PoW (e.g., Ethereum 2.0). 
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS): 
Token holders vote for a small number of delegates to validate blocks. Faster than 
PoW/PoS but more centralized (e.g., EOS).
